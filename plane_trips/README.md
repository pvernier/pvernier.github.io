# All the Plane Trips I Took in my Life in 3 Maps

Contain all the flights I took and their destinations (places I have lived in, visited or just transit).

## Methodology:
* The data was processed using PostgreSQL/Postgis
* How to make the curves is explained in this [tutorial](https://anitagraser.com/2011/08/20/visualizing-global-connections/)
* The maps were made with QGIS
* How to obtain the glow effect is explained in this [tutorial](https://nyalldawson.net/2015/04/introducing-qgis-live-layer-effects/)
